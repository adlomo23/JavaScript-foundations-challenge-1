# JavaScript Basics

Answer following questions in this file.

## What is JavaScript?

```
JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.
```

## About values

### What is a primitive value?

```
In JavaScript, a primitive is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties.
```

### Which are primitive values? Explain them with at least one example for primitive.

```
 There are 7 primitive data types: string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbol and null.
 String --> "Adrià"
 Number --> 23
 Bigint --> 999999999999999
 Boolean --> true
 Undefined --> (no actual arguments)
 Symbol --> Symbol("foo")
 Null --> null
 ```

## About variables

### What is a variable in JS?

```
A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.
```

### How many ways can we define a variable in JS? Is there any not recommended way?

```
We can declare variables in three different ways by using var, let and const keywords. Each keyword is used in some specific conditions.
```

### Which are the most used var naming conventions in JS?

```
Naming variables in JavaScript
 * Variable names must start with a letter, an underscore ( _ ) or a dollar sign ( $ ).
 * Variable names cannot contain spaces.
 * Variables cannot be the same as reserved keywords such as if or const .
 * By convention, JavaScript variable names are written in camelCase.
```

## About operators

### Which are the main comparison operators in JS? Explain them with at least one example for primitive.

```
Equal (==) --> Returns true if the operands are equal.	

Not equal (!=) --> Returns true if the operands are not equal.	

Strict equal (===) --> Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type. See also Object.is and sameness in JS.

Strict not equal (!==) --> Returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of different type.

Greater than (>) --> Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.	

Greater than or equal (>=) --> Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

Less than (<) --> Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.

Less than or equal (<=) --> Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.


```

### Which are the main logical operators in JS? Explain them with at least one example for primitive.

```
Logical AND (&&) --> This operator returns true if both of its operands are true, and false otherwise.

Logical OR (||) --> This operator returns true if at least one of its operands is true, and false if both operands are false.

Logical NOT (!) --> This operator is used to negate a Boolean value. It returns true if the operand is false, and false if the operand is true.
```
